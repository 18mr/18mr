## 18 Million Rising Collaborative Research Project

*Last updated: 1/7/2019*

This collaborative research project between 18 Million Rising (18MR) and Rachel Kuo (PhD Candidate, NYU) investigates Asian American political formations in digital ecosystems. Areas of work within this project include a) conducting an assessment of the landscape of Asian American politics in relation to current social justice movements and digital environments b) evaluating the impact of different digital tools for organizing and online campaign initiatives, as well as better assessing how organizing work shapes digital environment c) identifying opportunities and challenges for political education and coalition building and d) making historical connections across political issues and situating digital organizing within social movement history. 

Kuo’s dissertation examines how collective Asian/American politics aimed towards solidarity and coalition can emerge across inequalities and racial differences, and the role of media, communications, and technologies in shaping racial politics. Rather than taking solidarity for granted, her project tracks contradictions and challenges in pursuits of solidarity and how digital media technologies enable and complicate cross-racial and cross-class ‘solidarities’ in social justice movements. This collaborative project will use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods and sources, including interviews and storytelling, data and network analysis, surveys, mapping, and historical archives and papers from activists and organizations.
