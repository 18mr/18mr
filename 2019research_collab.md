## 18 Million Rising Collaborative Research Project

*Last updated: 1/14/2019*

Asian American online activism is powerful and complex. When we’re working together online, we can create the social and political change we need. But, we’re facing growing threats to our communities and have to strengthen our online organizing skills. That’s where our exciting new partnership comes in!


**18 Million Rising (18MR)** has teamed up with **Rachel Kuo (PhD Candidate, NYU)** for a collaborative research project to investigate how Asian American politics and activism forms online. By studying online activism, we can grow our collective power. 

**This project includes work on:** 

- Understanding the landscape of Asian American politics and its connection to current social justice movements and online spaces 
- Evaluating different digital tools for organizing and online campaigns, as well as better understanding how organizing work shapes online spaces 
- Identifying opportunities and challenges for political education and coalition building
- Making historical connections across political issues and locating digital organizing within social movement history 



Kuo’s research and writing looks at how Asian/American politics supporting solidarity and coalition building can happen despite inequalities and racial differences. She also explores how media, communications, and tech shapes racial politics. This project tracks challenges to building solidarity, including how tech can help or complicate cross-racial and cross-class solidarity in activist movements. 

The 18MR x Rachel Kuo collaborative project will use a range of methods and sources, including interviews and storytelling, data and network analysis, surveys, mapping, and historical archives and papers from activists and organizations.
