Cynthia has been a Civic Engagement Fellow and Editor & Campaign Strategist for 18MR.org. As a consultant, she also works with the Four Freedoms Fund at Public Interest Projects, focusing on immigrant rights, integration, and civic engagement. Recently, Cynthia also helped coordinate arts and cultural organizing strategies in the immigrant rights movement for The Culture Group and Culture/Strike, and was Agenda Development Lead for the 2013 National Immigrant Integration Conference in Miami. Cynthia is Managing Blog Editor for Hyphen, and co-founded NYU Wagner's first AAPI student group, the Asian Pacific American Student Alliance (APASA). She was born and raised in Seattle and reluctantly admits to clichés such as playing in bands and once making espresso for a living – but is proud that she went to the high school where Bruce Lee first demonstrated his famous “one-inch punch.”
