Cayden Mak builds technology and designs beautiful things to help build movement both online and off. Their work has long occupied the intersection of social justice and technology, whether it’s mapping responses to the Zimmerman verdict or punking the Gap for their international labor abuses. They are part of [Changelab](http://changelabinfo.com)'s core RaceLab, and their writing can be found in _Civicist_, _The Grassroots Fundraising Journal_, and other publications that concern themselves with people power and the internet. 

Prior to 18MR.org, they taught intro media studies courses, organized marginalized academic labor, and contested corporate power at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. While in graduate school, they co-founded New York Students Rising, a network of student organizers working for justice and equity in public higher education in New York State. They also helped found [Youngist](http://youngist.org), a young people-powered movement media network.

In their spare time, they try to stay up on critical theory, hang with their cats, and organize locally in Oakland, California to [build community-designed affordable housing](http://proposal.e12thoakland.org).

They’re particularly interested in understanding how technology shapes our collective political imagination, both online and off, the subject of their forthcoming MFA thesis from UB.
