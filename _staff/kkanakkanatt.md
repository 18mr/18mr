Kirin is a National Organizer at Resource Generation. Kirin is a fierce, queer, first generation South Asian cis femme with a middle class background. Kirin has spent the past 7 years crossing issue lines to build power at the intersections in marginalized communities. She has political homes in many movements including student power, racial equity, queer and gender based liberation, reproductive rights and climate justice. When she is not plotting the revolution, she can be found gushing about how great the Midwest is, reveling in the power of femmes, or refining her henna skills.
