PaKou comes to 18MR with 15 years of anti-racism organizing experience and after nearly two years of field organizing with MoveOn.org. She is also principal of Tseng Development Group, a firm that provides consulting, training, and coaching on anti-racist/anti-oppressive leadership development, organizational growth, and systems change. Born and raised in the Midwest, PaKou takes great pride reppin APIs living in the nationâ€™s midsection. Some of her favorite non-campaigning activities include entertaining two young daughters, squeezing in occasional adult-only evenings with her spouse, chasing culinary adventures, and dreaming about reviving a long-lost singing career.
