Vanessa holds a Masters in Higher Education from the Morgridge College of Education at the University of Denver. She is passionate about scholar activism, community engagement, and addressing issues of social justice and inequity. Her research interests focus on intersectionality within the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, particularly with Southeast Asian Americans and student activists. However, much of her time is dedicated to helping in the progressive AAPI movement, both locally and nationally. She is a national speaker on Asian American collegiate activism and coalition building, recently helping to found and Co-Chair the Coalition of API Americans Collaborating Together to Unite the Southwest (CAACTUS). She loves pugs, ice cream, and having the sun out when it rains.
