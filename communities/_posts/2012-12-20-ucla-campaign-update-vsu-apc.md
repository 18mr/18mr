<p>Thanks to you, things are moving forward at UCLA around the <a href="http://act.engagementlab.org/letter/UCLA_campaign_B/">campaign to implement a diversity requirement</a>. The Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) provides an update on their meeting last week with Chancellor Block.</p>	

For those that <a href="http://act.engagementlab.org/letter/UCLA_campaign_B/">signed the letter to UCLA</a>, thank you again for joining 18MR, the Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), and the Asian Pacific Coalition (APC) at UCLA to take a stand against campus hate. <strong>Your letters made a difference!</strong>

From Roman Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Student Union at UCLA:

<em>Thank you for all your support, the letters really helped and opened the Academic Senate to look into the diversity requirement.

<p>Overall, the VSU and the APC had a good meeting with Chancellor Block last Friday. They received the following commitments:</p>

<li>A follow-up meeting during the Spring 2013 Semester</li>

<li>Ongoing discussion to implement diversity programs</li>

<li>Exploring ways to reinstate the Asian American Studies Center's Leadership Development Coordinator</li>

<li>Look for ways to support student cultural organizations, with culture-focused shows as a means to promote diversity</li>

<li>A Diversity Summit, along with a student-faculty sustained dialogue on diversity</em></li>

<br>Let's continue to support the students at UCLA and help spread the word by <a href="http://act.engagementlab.org/go/588?t=1&amp;akid=321.105028.Xjw_sC" target="_blank">sharing the petition link</a>.
