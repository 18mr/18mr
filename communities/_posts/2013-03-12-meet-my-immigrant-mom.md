Help tell the story of immigrant women through photos of people you love.  If you have an immigrant mom (or have friends who do), you can submit a picture and description about your mom, where she lives, and something special you'd like to share about her to the ['Meet My Immigrant Mom' tumblr](http://meetmyimmigrantmom.tumblr.com/).
 
What makes her so awesome and unique? How does she inspire you? What is her migration story? What is a favorite meal she cooks? How has she helped you be the person you are today? How does she help others?

Send the pictures and caption to [Bekah at NDWA](mailto:bekah@domesticworkers.org) or post them directly [here](http://www.tumblr.com/blog/meetmyimmigrantmom%20).

This project is part of the __[We Belong Together](http://www.domesticworkers.org/we-belong-together)__ campaign, an initiative of the [National Domestic Workers Alliance](http://www.domesticworkers.org/) and 18MR.org partner the [National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum](http://www.napawf.org/), with the participation of women’s organizations, immigrant rights groups, children, and families across the country.
 
We Belong Together was formed on Mothers’ Day 2010, when a group of women [traveled to Arizona](http://www.webelongtogether.org/activities/delegation-arizona) after the passage of the anti-immigrant law SB1070 to investigate how the new law would affect women, children, and families in that state. We Belong Together lifts up the experiences of women and children within the immigration dialogue, and is working toward a fair and inclusive roadmap to citizenship that will protect the unity, rights, and dignity of all families and communities.
