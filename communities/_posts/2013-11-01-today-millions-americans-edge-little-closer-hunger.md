featured-alt-text: "An infographic. Title: 'Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders on Food Stamps.' Over 1 million Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders receive SNAP benefits. Today, SNAP benefits were reduced to a mere $1.40 per person per meal. SNAP BASICS section: SNAP stands for 'Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,' otherwise known as food stamps. 47,669,430 Americans rely on SNAP. The average individual gets $133.19 per month. The average household gets $275.42 per month. SNAP HOUSEHOLDS BY RACE section: a pie chart showing beneficiaries of SNAP by race, with the 2.2% AAPI figure pulled out. The caption reads 'AAPIs are only 2.2% of the households out of the general population who receive SNAP benefits...' AAPI SNAP HOUSEHOLDS section: ...but controlling for the number of households in each racial group, the numbers look much different. A series of bar charts show that overall, 11.9% of AAPIs receive SNAP. 7.8% of Asians recieve SNAP, which is disaggregated into 20.9% of Cambodians, 32.7% of Hmong, 16.3% of Laotians, and 11.9% of Vietnamese. 22.3% of Pacific Islanders receive SNAP. Separated, statics show not all Asian American communities are equally prosperous. Southeast Asian American families tend to struggle the most with food access. The footer reads: FOOD ACCESS IS AN ASIAN AMERICAN ISSUE, with the 18MR.org logo."

Today, the cuts from the expiration of the 2009 Recovery Act kick in for over 47 million people. Contrary to what you might think, these cuts are going to hurt Asian American & Pacific Islander families.

Food access is an issue for every community.
