Here at 18MR, we’re wrapping up for the year and taking a much needed breather, which also means taking a look back on all we’ve accomplished this year.

It was my great honor to take the reins at 18MR in September, after four years of service on staff. I’m proud of the work we do and the culture that we’ve built. I couldn’t be happier with our team -- our current staff, Taz and Oanh-Nhi -- but also our staff alums, core volunteers, campaign partners, and members like you. We’re stronger together.

<strong><a href="http://action.18mr.org/donate" target="_blank">Help us preserve that strength in 2017 by becoming a sustaining donor. For as little as $5 a month, you ensure that we can keep fighting for the causes that matter to you.</a></strong>

We know little what next year holds in store for us. But we do know one thing: the work of organizers and advocates like you will be absolutely crucial. As I’ve connected with many of you around the country, you’ve told me that 18MR provides a powerful platform for you to take action. I’m proud to hear that many of you, like me, think of 18MR your political home.

<strong><a href="http://action.18mr.org/donate" target="_blank">That’s why I’m asking you to become a monthly sustaining donor. Your contribution can be as little as $5 a month -- but set it up today, and help shore up our resources to weather 2017’s storms together.</a></strong>

Whether you joined us by raising your voice to transform representation of Asian Americans on the silver screen or volunteering to ensure our community’s representation at the ballot box through VoterVOX; whether you downloaded this year’s #MyAAPIVote album or shared your perspective in a Twitter town hall; you know that our core mission is to amplify <em>your </em>voice -- and <em>our </em>power.<figure><a href="http://action.18mr.org/donate" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2rOXnjA21rWwvQBNvIBlmazbyR0sSfiVuvvNC6EUvNl40ojZaw1FKCYX63eHSSVS__OPseeKjzpDKxTL_xKclKxu_XbmVccXgdgBbK4twbcb32vCO431Q0VlixMXY5EL7EpC0gu7" alt="" title="" align="center" width="640" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%; max-width: 640px;"></a></figure>

<strong><a href="http://action.18mr.org/donate" target="_blank">There is no better way to make this political home truly yours than by becoming a sustaining donor.</a></strong> Join us today. Chip in at any amount you choose: $5, $15, or $25 a month will expand our capacity to fight for all of us in 2017.

Wishing you health, happiness, and resilience in the New Year,

Cayden Mak Executive Director, 18MR.org
