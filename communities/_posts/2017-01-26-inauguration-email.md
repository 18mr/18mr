<p>Today, Donald Trump is taking oath of office to become the 45th U.S. President.
</p>
<p><strong>We are filled with worry about what the future might hold </strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong> we remain steadfast in our commitment to you. </strong>18MillionRising.org has always worked to amplify the voices of our Asian American and Pacific Islander sisters and brothers by telling our stories and mobilizing action against injustices that have targeted our communities.
</p>
<p><strong>In collaboration with activists like you, we’ve done <a href="http://18millionrising.org/2017/01/a-recap-of-2016.html" target="_blank">a lot of badass things</a> and we'll continue to center our work with our power, histories, and imagination.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our work is inspired by our shero Grace Lee Boggs who always emphasized the importance of growing our souls to achieve revolution.</p>

<p>She said: “What I mean by souls is the capacity to create the world anew which each of us has. How do we talk about that with one another? Because it’s important to talk - it’s not only important to act, it’s important to talk because when you talk you begin to create new ideas and new languages. We’ve all been damaged by this system... <strong>And we all have to change what we say, what we do, what we think, what we imagine.</strong>”<sup>1</sup>

</p><p><strong><a href="http://18millionrising.org/pitch/" target="_blank">At 18MR, we want to talk. If injustice is happening in your neighborhood or city or if you have new ideas you want to share, get in touch with us so we can reimagine together.</a></strong></p><a href="http://18millionrising.org/pitch/" target="_blank">

<p>When Trump was elected, we shared our continued re-commitment for the next four years and beyond:<br></p>

<ul><li><p>We will continue to organize against the forces of xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Black racism and misogyny that made today possible.</p></li><li><p>We will create bolder, love deeper, and work harder while dismantling systems of oppression.</p></li><li><p>We will continue to build with our communities and across other communities of color.</p></li><li><p>We will participate in actions led by organizations that are strengthening our communities, locally and nationally.</p></li><li><p>We will organize for a world where our humanity is fully present and a world that allows people of color, Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ, undocumented and immigrant folks to thrive and not just survive.</p></li><li><p>We will hold tight to this vision of the world we want to create.</p></li></ul><strong>

<strong><a href="http://18millionrising.org/pitch/" target="_blank">If our work resonates with you, let us know if you have a campaign or blog post idea.</a></strong>

<p>Thanks for continuing to support us. We’re looking onward to the work we’ll create together.</p><p><br></p>
