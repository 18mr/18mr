blurb: "Asian Americans won the right to vote as American citizens in 1952 -- only 66 years ago. And it’s time to put that right into action. In this moment in history, our democracy is under attack, and our votes are critical."
tweet: "Asian Americans only won the right to vote as Asian Americans 66 years ago. Yet, only 56% of us are even registered. This Election Day, let's get out and vote. %23OurAAPIVote "
facebook: "Asian Americans can be the decisive vote in elections -- we’re 5% or more of eligible voters in battleground states. But, we have the lowest voter turnout of any racial group. This Election Day, we want you to go out and vote, and to encourage your friends, family, and community to go out and vote with you."

*Asian Americans won the right to vote as American citizens in 1952 -- only 66 years ago. And it’s time to put that right into action* In this moment in history, our democracy is under attack, and our votes are critical.

Asian Americans can be the decisive vote in elections -- we’re 5% or more of eligible voters in battleground states. But, we have the lowest voter turnout of any racial group, and we shouldn’t be known for this. *This Election Day, we want you to go out and vote, and to encourage your friends, family, and community to go out and vote with you.*

We want voting to feel easy and necessary in our communities. [Check out vote.18mr.org to learn why should AAPIs vote, how to get registered, and what to do on Election Day.](vote.18mr.org)
