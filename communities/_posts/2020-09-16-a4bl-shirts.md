**At 18MR, [Asians for Black Lives is more than a slogan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBD8WsyHvmr/).** It’s a call to action. It’s a reminder that *to be Asian American is to be political.* And it means we must actually invest in a world where Black life flourishes!

**[This month, we’re re-launching our popular “Asians for Black Lives” shirts to fund two Black-led groups who are reimagining safety and community care, beyond the police.](https://www.bonfire.com/asians-for-black-lives/)** 100% of proceeds from each shirt will be split between [Freedom, Inc.](https://freedom-inc.org/) in Wisconsin, [The Knights & Orchids Society (TKO)](https://www.tkosociety.com/) in Alabama, and 18 Million Rising! We’re proud to support groups that are doing the work of building transformative community power through Black-led care work.

**One of the most powerful ways we can show up for Black lives is by resourcing Black organizing.** For us, A4BL means investing in Black organizing that is building a world where Black trans folks, Black survivors of domestic and sexual assault, and Black children are safe and thriving. We know this essential work is often undervalued and underfunded, especially in the Midwest and deep South. **Our goal is to raise over $20,000 with this shirt to resource Black care work that’s being led by Black trans, queer, and gender non-conforming folks in Wisconsin and Alabama!**

*About the beneficiaries:*

**Freedom, Inc. (FI)** is a Black and Southeast Asian organization in Madison, Wisconsin which has [fought and won police free schools in their city!](https://www.wpr.org/madison-school-board-votes-end-contract-police-department?fbclid=IwAR2id49cXXBX_9k3JftfrNOEnSAYvpYLnhGrXrGJYlrxwmes5X1EKg3IE3A) Prior to COVID-19 and now, FI provides direct support to LGBTQ, women, and children survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault through a weekly food and supplies pantry, case management, and referrals to mental health and housing resources. 

The Knights & Orchids (TKO) Society is a Black trans, queer, and gender non-conforming (TQGNC) led organization building power across rural towns in Alabama. In the last year, they’ve provided almost 100,000 lbs of food and essential supplies to over a thousand community members, as well as thousands of hours of free peer health care navigation services for TQGNC folks. [TKO is currently raising funds to buy a building to house all the powerful work they’re doing.](https://fundly.com/black-sheep-building-fund-innovation-center)
