Yesterday was the most important election in a generation. While ballots are counted, we probably won’t know the results for the next few days or possibly even longer. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from falsely declaring victory and demanding an end to ballot counting. Although this is a chaotic and stressful time, we want you to know: we’re not going anywhere. 

If there are unclear results, evidence of election tampering, or if Trump refuses to step down from power despite clearly losing, we are here to offer you opportunities to take meaningful collective action.

Unfortunately, [a coup is possible.](https://isthisacoup.com/) Here are [10 things that you need to know](https://choosedemocracy.us/prepare/#10things) in order to respond and how you can get ready to stop one:

<h2>SIGN THE PETITION</h2>

<b>[KEEP COUNTING EVERY VOTE.](https://action.18mr.org/counteveryvote/)</b> Trump is itching for a coup and has already falsely proclaimed victory when many states are still counting ballots. Every single vote must be counted. Voters determine elections, not wanna-be dictators. With our democracy on the line, we’re counting on you to ensure the U.S. election is fair and accurate. <b>[Tell your U.S. Governors and election officials: COUNT EVERY VOTE.](https://action.18mr.org/counteveryvote/)</b>

<h2>GET ORIENTED</h2>

Our friend Deepa Iyer came up with [a handy guide that can help you figure out where you fit in](https://dviyer.medium.com/mapping-our-social-change-roles-in-times-of-crisis-8bbe71a8ab01) and what you can offer in this moment. 

Nonviolent resistance is one of the most powerful forces to end dictatorship and advance democracy. The Hold The Line Guide [maps out different election scenarios](https://holdthelineguide.com/) and how we can topple unjust systems. 

<h2>TAKE ACTION</h2>

If you take to the streets, make sure you read [Stopping the Coup: The 2020 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WtDZYQ7Q-PUhxhv8VuRVfeD7q3DSpthktlYD-nx4pSc/edit#) to know how to effectively organize and do direct actions.

<h2>CULTIVATE CARE</h2>

Your own health and wellbeing matters too. Here’s a [care package of poems, meditations, films,](https://smithsonianapa.org/care/) and other cultural nutrients for times like this. Our friend [Yumi Sakugawa offers guided meditations](https://www.crowdcast.io/yumisakugawa) on a sliding scale from sitting with difficult emotions to mindfulness as a survival strategy.

<b><i>We are in this together.</i></b> 

We have a long history of resistance where our ancestors decided their own futures by pushing for change. That history does not end today. At a time when we can so easily slip into hopelessness or resignation, banding together is more important than ever. 

<b>As we demand all votes are counted, we continue their legacy by organizing our communities and building a future where we can all thrive, beyond the ballot box.<b> We know that this is just one moment in a longer timeline for liberation. 

Like our ancestors, we too are changing a system that will resist us at all costs. And, like them we’re organizing for a world where Asian Americans and our loved ones can thrive, built by us, for us.
