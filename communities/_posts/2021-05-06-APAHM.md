<b>For Asian American Heritage Month (APAHM) this year, we’re honoring the land and its lifelong stewards.</b> This past year taught us that the fight for abolition and climate justice are deeply connected. Demilitarization and stopping deforestation are our best medicine against deadly pandemics, among other harmful outcomes of the human-made climate crisis. 

This month, we celebrate the many ways Asian and Pacific Islander Americans take care of each other and the earth through community organizing, queer farming, politicized art and more. Find ways to celebrate APA environmental justice with us all month long!
