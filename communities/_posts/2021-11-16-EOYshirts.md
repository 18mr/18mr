We’re excited to launch our new shirts in collaboration with movement artist Ashley Lukashevsky! **[“My Elders Taught Me” is a duo of shirts inspired by the strength and visionary leadership of our elders and ancestors.](https://www.bonfire.com/store/18-million-rising/)**

Many of our elders had to take risks to survive and radically change their conditions. They adapted, innovated, and dreamed of new possibilities. From immigrant aunties to beloved activist elders - our organizing work wouldn’t be possible without them!
We take in their fiery spirit and honor it with our own fight for social change. We dream of a world where our communities aren’t torn apart by prisons and deportation. A world where workers have rights and dignity. Where the earth is healed. Where our votes count. **A world where our elders are safe, and so are we.**

**Join us in building this new world.**

<h1>My Elders Taught Me How To Cook</h1>

<a href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/18-million-rising/"><img src= "/static/images/featured/sweatshirt 1_.png"></a>

Inspired by Asian culinary traditions, this spicy shirt depicts a barbecued police pig and its baton going up in smoke and flames.
Garlic, chilies, and handcuffs are spread out across a banana leaf. We’re here to roast police violence of all kinds -- from ICE raids to militarized weapons to high-tech surveillance.
This is a bold and unapologetic message for Asian America: Cages and cops don’t keep us safe! We keep us safe!


<h1>My Elders Taught Me How To Pray</h1>
Amidst swirling incense lies an overturned police car. We’re sending up abolitionist prayers to transform a world of harm and punishment into one of healing and interdependence.
Surrounding the incense and police car are scenes of transformation. From burning prisons comes abundance and life-giving nature: butterflies, birds, flowers. We’re calling on our elders and ancestors to guide our work in tearing down all systems of violence and oppression.

<h1>Each shirt supports 18 Million Rising</h1>

**We’re raising $25,000 to continue our urgent Asian American organizing work in 2022.** Proceeds from shirt sales will support our grassroots campaigns, projects, and community trainings for racial justice and immigrant rights. 
This year, 18MR formally “came out” as an abolitionist organization. 18MR has made the conscious choice to be loud and unapologetic about our belief that liberation does not include false solutions like policing, hate crimes laws, prisons, or ICE. Help us bring this energy into the new year by supporting our work!

<h1>Our artist, Ashley Lukashevsky</h1>

<a href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/18-million-rising/"><img src= '/static/images/featured/artist.png'></a> 

[Ashley Lukashevsky](http://www.ashleylukashevsky.com/) is an illustrator and visual artist born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, and currently working between Los Angeles and Honolulu.

They use illustration and visual art as a tool to strengthen social movements for racial justice, immigrant justice, climate justice, mental health and LGBTQIA+ liberation. "I think that in order to tear down harmful systems, we need to be able to envision a world without them. I’m trying to draw what that world looks like," says Ashley.
