<h1>To our community,</h1>

and especially the families and friends of the Monterey Park victims, know that you are not alone in your pain, your fears, your anger, your desire to dive into action, your urge to disconnect, your need to be with your people. Our team at 18 Million Rising is devastated by the horrific attacks at the Lunar New Year celebrations in Monterey Park. Often a time for families to reunite, Lunar New Year is sacred for many Asian Americans to gather and celebrate. As we grieve this latest tremendous loss, we will continue to organize to keep our communities safe and connected. 

It is important that our communities have the opportunity to make sense of both the legacies of structural violence, and the horrors of intra-community harm in this tragedy. As a digital-first organization, we lift up those utilizing the power of digital community to bring us together to grieve, process, and connect, even if we are physically apart. 

Please share this list of digital spaces with your loved ones and remember the words of Grace Lee Boggs: “The only way to survive is by taking care of one another.”.
