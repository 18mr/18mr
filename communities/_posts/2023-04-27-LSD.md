In 2022, So Yun Um, a Korean American filmmaker, released her documentary Liquor Store Dreams. The film is an intimate portrait of two Korean American children of liquor store owners who set out to bridge generational divides with their immigrant parents and reckon with the legacy of the LA Uprisings.

18 Million Rising partnered with Liquor Store Dreams to host a discussion panel and created a resource guide. Our panel moderated by our own Organizing Director Sharmin Hossain included panelists Danny Park founder of  Skid Row People’s Market's, Church Without Walls’ Pastor Cue, and Liquor Store Dreams Director So Yun Um.

So Yun Um and Danny Park, owner of Skid Row People’s Market, are taking Liquor Store Dreams to private screenings, community events, and speaking engagements to change minds, heal from our histories, and build community. Their goals are to hold discussions on topics like combating anti-Blackness in Asian American communities, tackle difficult intergenerational conversations, and address generational divides between first and second generation immigrants. 

The 1992 Los Angeles Uprising was a series of civil disturbances that occurred in LA in April and May 1992 after a jury acquitted four LAPD off icers charged with use of excessive force in the arrest and beating of Rodney King. The incident was caught on video and shown widely on TV broadcasts. South Central LA and Koreatown sitting just north of it were significantly damaged, with many Korean businesses affected by widespread theft, arson, and assault. 

Although police violence and an unjust verdict were the catalysts of the uprisings, tension had already been growing from years of systematically stripping Black communities of resources, investment, and economic opportunity. 

2022 marked the 30 year anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles uprisings. Thirty years later, and three years after the 2020 uprisings for Black lives, protests against racial violence and police brutality are ongoing.

The '92 LA Uprising brought issues of anti-Black racism, police brutality, and economic violence to light. Media attention during that time pitted Black and Korean communities against each other, playing up tensions. As we continue to fight for a world without prisons, policing, and capitalism, we're also taking the time to reflect on our own complicity in racial and economic violence.
