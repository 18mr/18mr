<h1>18MR x Persuasians</h1>

We’re teaming up with Persuasians, the first Asian drag house from the South, along with drag performers in Texas to celebrate trans liberation. Join us for a virtual drag night of celebration and FUN-raising for [The Knights & Orchids Society: Dragging Transphobia!](https://www.tkosociety.org/)

Hosted by the beautiful and infamous Mx. SHI of Persuasians, Dragging Transphobia will include performers hailing from Georgia and Texas, including: [Scarlet Vixen,](https://www.instagram.com/scarletvixen/) [Al Schlong,](https://www.facebook.com/aldirtysouth) [Jawan Chokra,](https://www.instagram.com/jawanchokra_/) [Dust Bunny](https://www.instagram.com/dustxbunnyb/), [Miss He,](https://www.instagram.com/misshethequeen/) and [Tucker Bleu.](https://www.tiktok.com/@kingtuckerbleu)

100% of proceeds will go directly to [The TKO Society](https://www.tkosociety.org/), a rad Black & queer-led organization based in Alabama. They build the power of TLGB+ Black people across the South by providing a spectrum of health and wellness services and reproductive care. Let’s dance for liberation together.
