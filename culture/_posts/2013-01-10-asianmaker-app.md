Despite national media attention and almost 10,000 total [signatures on 18MR]("http://act.engagementlab.org/sign/18MR_MakeMeAsian_B/") and Peter Chin's petitions combined, Google has refused to remove the [Make me Asian]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makemeasian&amp;hl=en") and [Make me Indian]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makemeindian&amp;hl=en") apps from its Google Play store. 

So what next? 18MR asks the question: [what happens when you make Asians "Asian"?]("http://act.engagementlab.org/sign/18MR_MakeMeAsian_B/") The community's response to the racist Android apps Make Me Asian" and "Make Me Indian" (along with a host of other problematic apps) by developer Kimbery Deiss have gotten coverage on national news channels like CNN, Huffington Post and The Daily Beast.

[Anchors and pundits have talked about the apps]("http://www.18millionrising.org/blog/2013/jan/8/cnn-panel-debates-make-me-asian-app/") being offensive to Asian Americans and Native Americans, but often shy away from why.

<strong>Illustrating a racial or ethnic group via stereotypical characteristics and reducing them to those characteristics is racist.</strong>

So 18MR wondered: what happens when you make Asians "Asian"? In order to find out, we tried the app out ourselves. Here's what we ended up with:

If you're as creeped out as we are, we bet that George, Mindy, Aziz and Jeremy would be pretty creeped out, too. Check out even more ridiculous celebrity "Asianmakers" on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/18MillionRising">Facebook page.

If you think these pics and the "Make me Asian" app is all sorts of wrong, please share these celebrity images with them on Facebook/Twitter with the hastag <strong>#makemeracist</strong> and ask them to signal boost <a href="http://act.engagementlab.org/sign/18MR_MakeMeAsian_B/">our petition</a> to take down these racist apps (and stay tuned for efforts around "Make me Indian").

If you need a nudge, you can lift this sample tweet (just remember to change the handle to whichever celebrity you're tweeting at):

[Tweet @azizansari/@mindykaling/@kalpenn/etc]("http://act.engagementlab.org/go/622?t=3&amp;akid=334.105051.h8QEhY" target="_blank"): Hey @azizansari have you seen the Make Me Asian app? bit.ly/aa-asian More like #makemeracist! Let's take it down. bit.ly/makemeasian
