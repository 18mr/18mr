Here are all 26 poems from Micropoems for #NoMuslimBanEver created in partnership with [Kaya Press](http://kaya.com). 

The Trump administration's Muslim Ban 3.0 was scheduled to go into effect on Oct 18th. In an effort to push back, we launched Micropoems for #NoMuslimBanEver to use poetry by Asian Americans as a form of resistance to this terrible executive order. 

From October 9-21, 13 poets wrote Micropoems for #NoMuslimBanEver. Poets include [Rajiv Mohabir](http://www.rajivmohabir.com/), [Ching-In Chen](www.chinginchen.com), [Terisa Siagatonu](http://www.terisasiagatonu.com/), [Hatefas Yop](http://poetrybyhati.bigcartel.com/), [Shamala Gallagher](www.shamalagallagher.com), [Jenna Lê](https://jennalewriting.com/), [Koon Woon](http://koonwoonhomepage.blogspot.com/), [Raena Shirali](www.raenashirali.com), [Salvin Chahal](salvinchahal.com), [Tarfia Faizullah](http://www.tfaizullah.com/), [Devi S Laskar](http://www.devislaskar.com/), [Hari Alluri](https://harialluri.wordpress.com/) & [Tanzila Ahmed](tazzystar.me). 

Poetry can be a tool of resistance. While we do more traditional forms of activism and advocacy, we must also find ways to build solidarity across cultures and words.
