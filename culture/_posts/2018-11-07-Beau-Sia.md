be proud<br>
for seizing the moment.<br>

a moment born<br>
from those<br>
who passed on<br>
before our birth.<br>

a moment built<br>
by communities<br>
committed<br>
to continue<br>
striving together.<br>

a moment filled<br>
with individuals<br>
willing<br>
to challenge themselves<br>
to do more.<br>

every step taken<br>
has mattered.<br>

every choice<br>
beyond your comfort<br>
has had impact.<br>

every action<br>
towards<br>
the world you want to live in<br>
has helped us<br>
arrive at this moment.<br>

when our voices<br>
no longer relegated<br>
to the margins.<br>

when our people<br>
have begun to realize<br>
the collective power<br>
we share.<br>

when our vision<br>
for who we are<br>
in this nation<br>
on the verge<br>
of full bloom.<br>

still, we have yet<br>
to rise beyond<br>
inequality,<br>
injustice,<br>
inhumanity<br>
of the past<br>
still present.<br>

still, we have yet<br>
to inspire everyone<br>
to contribute<br>
to the work<br>
still necessary.<br>

still, we have yet<br>
to raise<br>
the level<br>
of conviction<br>
to be relentless<br>
and never still.<br>

for as we celebrate<br>
what we've achieved,<br>
let us also be focused<br>
on why we must<br>
keep going.<br>

we are called<br>
to protect all<br>
who are not safe.<br>

we are called<br>
to uplift all<br>
who take action<br>
on our behalf.<br>

we are called<br>
to engage all<br>
who will doubt<br>
on this work.<br>

we are called<br>
to inspire all<br>
who will dream<br>
on the future.<br>

we are called<br>
to strengthen all<br>
who will carry us<br>
on every day.<br>

all of this<br>
we are called to do.<br>

until<br>
our bodies<br>
are no longer<br>
a place<br>
for harm.<br>

until<br>
our choices are free<br>
to prosper.<br>

until<br>
our world<br>
receives<br>
reflects<br>
and<br>
represents<br>
us all.<br>
