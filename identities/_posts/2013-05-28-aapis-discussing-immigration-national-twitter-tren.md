The chat inspired 1,076 tweets by AAPIs in ONE DAY -- letting the world know that our voices cannot be ignored. These 1,000-plus tweets highlighted key immigration issues that impact us: family reunification, equal rights for LGBTQs, intersectionality, border security, and love for one another and our communities. That was our win this week."

Thanks to your participation, we managed to do something really incredible on Twitter: ___we turned our #18MillionHearts for Immigration Reform chat into a U.S. trend!___ 

As far as we know, no group of rabble-rousing, quick-witted AAPIs talking about immigration has ever trended on Twitter -- that is, until together we knocked the trend machine out of the park on Wednesday and ended up in Twitter jail for maxing out our allotted number of hourly tweets.

But more important than temporarily elbowing Paris Hilton off her pink Twitter throne, __#18MillionHearts for Immigration Reform inspired 1,076 tweets by AAPIs in ONE DAY -- letting the world know that our voices cannot be ignored.__ These 1,000-plus tweets highlighted key immigration issues that impact us: family reunification, equal rights for LGBTQs, intersectionality, border security, and love for one another and our communities. _That was our win this week._
 
And if for some reason you couldn’t join us for the Twitter chat, __you can get a really great overview of the conversation by checking out [#18MillionHearts for Immigration Reform on Storify](https://storify.com/18millionrising/18millionhearts-for-immigration-reform-the-twitte).__
