# Media Based Organizing as Resistance


18MillionRising.org uses media-based organizing as a tool to support our theory of change. 

Our definition of media-based organizing is a collaborative process that utilizes media, art, and technology in creative ways. The goal is to center community issues, and use media as a tool for individuals, communities, and groups to advocate for actions or solutions. 

We developed this zine as a supplemental resource for a 2019 Netroots Conference panel titled “Building Community Power: Media-Based Organizing as Resistance” organized by Laura Li, Campaigner, and Bianca Nozaki-Nasser, Product Strategist. Organizational partners for the panel include Media Mobilizing Project, Decolonize This, and Mijente.
