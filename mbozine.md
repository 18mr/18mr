# Media Based Organizing as Resistance

18MillionRising.org uses media-based organizing as a tool to support our theory of change. 

Our definition of media-based organizing is a collaborative process that utilizes media, art, and technology in creative ways. The goal is to center community issues, and use media as a tool for individuals, communities, and groups to advocate for actions or solutions. 

We developed this zine as a supplemental resource for a 2019 Netroots Conference panel titled “Building Community Power: Media-Based Organizing as Resistance” organized by Laura Li, Campaigner, and Bianca Nozaki-Nasser, Product Strategist. Organizational partners for the panel include Media Mobilizing Project, Decolonize This, and Mijente. 

The zine is available for download here. Please feel free to use and credit 18MillionRising.org and Bianca Nozaki-Nasser and Laura Li.
