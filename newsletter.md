<i><b>Looking for a specially curated newsletter on all things Asian America?</b></i> 

Welcome to <b><i>“Did You Eat Yet?”</i></b> 18MR’s new monthly newsletter! We chose this name because asking if you’ve eaten yet is one way that many Asian Americans show care for each other. This is a space for deep cuts like follow up on how campaigns are moving forward, access to our rad reading list, where we’re living on the internet, and how you can plug into events happening near you. Every month you’ll get a carefully curated newsletter from a member of the 18MR team that we hope lights up your day. 

<b><i>Make sure to sign up below to recieve a carefully curated newsletter from a member of the 18MR team once a month!</i></b>
