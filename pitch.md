#Have A Great Campaign Idea?

Whether you're an individual who has experienced injustice, or an organization who has been working with the grassroots and wants to soup up your campaign with 18MR.org's internet skills, we're always looking for new perspectives and wrongs to help right. Our best, most winning, campaigns come from our members. We're all ears.

#Want Us To Run Your Essay?

We're always looking for writers. If you've written, or would like to write, a personal essay about organizing work you're doing, original commentary on a pop culture phenomenon, or something else you think 18MR.org members will appreciate reading about, pitch it to us by describing what you're writing about and what the hook is for 18MR.org members in particular.

Please note that while we're happy to republish writing that has been published elsewhere, we do ask that you secure permissions before approaching 18MR.org. We do not offer compensation to writers at this time. Therefore, we encourage you to pitch first elsewhere where compensation is provided.

#Pitch Your Thing!
