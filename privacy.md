# Data Use Policy

Last updated: 7/20/2017

__In plain language: we take your privacy seriously. Most of our websites collect some minimal, basic information about you to help us improve our software and optimize our campaigns. We only collect personally identifying information when you provide it to us directly, and we share that personally identifying information only when it is relevant to the campaign or project you’ve volunteered that information for. We will never sell that information to turn a profit, and all our communications come with the option to opt out at any time (check the bottom of any email you've received from us). Below, you can find more detailed privacy and data use policies.__

In more legal language: this web site (18millionrising.org), as well as associated web sites (*.18mr.org and votervox.org) (“the services”) are operated by 18MillionRising.org (“18MR.org,” “we”, “us” and/or “our”) and has been created to accomplish our mission of building Asian American and Pacific Islander political power with the help of Web Site visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from you.

__General Policy__: 18MR.org has a firm commitment to internet privacy. You can use most of 18MR.org’s services without telling us who you are and without revealing any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). The only information we collect from a normal visit is information that cannot be used to specifically identify you (“Non-Personal Information”), which usually includes the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them.

__Personal Information__: The only time we collect Personal Information is when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, sign a petition to a decisionmaker, or register to participate in events and campaigns. Wherever we collect Personal Information we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. We do encourage you to voluntarily share Personal Information with us, because this information is an important part of how we build our movement.  By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

__How We Use the Information__:

__Non-Personal Information__: We use the Non-Personal Information collected to generate statistics and measure activity across the services in order to improve the quality of the services for our visitors.

__Personal Information__: We use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We consider your first name, city, state, and comments on petitions to be public information. Your personal home address and phone number will never be shared publicly.

If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.  For example, if you sign up for a campaign, we will use your Personal Information to send you updates and other information about the campaign. Or, if the campaign is targeting a certain decision maker, such as the President, we may share your name and location with the White House as part of a list of individuals who took action.

If we intend on using any Personal Information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will inform you of the anticipated use before the Personal Information is collected.

__Aggregated Personal Information__: In an ongoing effort to accomplish our mission and understand visitors better, 18MR.org may conduct research on its visitor’s demographics and interests based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and 18MR.org may share this aggregate information with its affiliates and allies. 18MR.org may also disclose aggregated visitor statistics in order to describe the size, scope, and demographics of its network. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.

__Storage__:  Both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy may be stored by 18MR.org itself or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. We make every effort to ensure the security of these databases.

If you’re curious, our primary petition platform provider is Action Network. [You can find their privacy policy here](https://actionnetwork.org/privacy).

__Donor Privacy Policy__: 18MR.org does not rent, share, sell or trade any Personal Information from online or offline donations. In addition, we do not rent, share, sell or trade information about what donations supporters have made.

__When We Share the Information__:

18MR.org is not interested in selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

__Affiliates and Allies__: We may share your name and/or email address with trusted organizations that share our mission and are aligned in the work we do in various issue areas. These organizations include partner organizations that may be organizing local events or co-sponsoring petitions that you may be interested in. We will not share your information with any individual or organization who is not engaged in furthering the success of 18MR.org.

__Action and Signup Pages__:  We do not share the information you’ve given us on Action and Signup pages with unaffiliated groups or individuals without your explicit permission. For petitions, letters to the editor, and surveys you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it campaign targets specifically noted on the signup page. If you place a phone call to a decisionmaker using our platform, your phone number may be disclosed to the call recipient during the course of that phone call.

__Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties__: 18MR.org sometimes hires other companies to perform certain functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we take precautions to provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

__Legal Requirements__: We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of 18MR.org, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of other web site visitors or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

__Account Creation__: By registering an account/password for any of our services, we also may create an account for you on affiliated platforms so you can easily receive updates and important information from us. In compliance with federal law, every email comes with a notice to stop or amend your subscription.

__Security__: 18MR.org makes great efforts to protect the Personal Information provided via our services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

18MR.org also strives to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive visitor payment information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies. If you choose to make a donation, your credit card information will be used only for transactions through our secure online payment system. If you choose to make that donation recurring, the information will be stored by our third party payment processors, and is not stored or seen by 18MR.org. 18MR.org does not sell or otherwise disclose such visitor payment information outside the organization.

__Updates and Email Tracking__: We strive to provide you accurate and timely information about our campaign activities. In order to improve our engagement with our member network, we track whether the emails we send to you are being opened and whether the links they contain are being clicked.

__Unsubscribing__: You may opt out of these communications at any time via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email we send. If you would like to update your subscription preferences on Action Network, [you may do so here](https://actionnetwork.org/subscriptions).

__Cookies__: Like most web sites, our services may place a “cookie,” or small file, in the browser files of a visitor’s computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so that you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our the services. This allows us to personalize the services to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors.

__Updating the Privacy Policy__: 18MR.org does reserve the right to change its policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice as necessary to support the movement.  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Web Site after any changes are made to this Privacy Policy indicates your agreement with the terms of the changed Privacy Policy.

__Exclusions__: This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by 18MR.org through the services.  The Privacy Policy does not apply to any unsolicited information provided to us through the services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the services and any unsolicited submissions. All such information will be treated as public information.

__Links to Other Web Sites__:  This Privacy Policy applies only to the services named above. The services contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by 18MR.org (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Web Site do not imply that 18MR.org endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

__Social Media__:  Through the Web Site, you can choose to access certain social media web sites and services that are owned and controlled by third parties (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) (the “Social Media Services”). When you elect to access and use the Social Media Services, you will be sharing your information (which will include personal information if you elect to share such information) with those Social Media Services. As with other Third Party Sites, the information that you share with the Social Media Services will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such Social Media Services and not by the policies and procedures we describe here.

__Other Terms and Conditions__: Your access to and use of the Web Site is subject to the [Terms of Use](/terms).
