#Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. We understand that your personal information is just that: yours. We will never give it to any entity or organization without your consent, and we sure as hell won't sell it to turn a profit.

For petitions, open letters, or similar public communications that you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit this information to members of Congress, the President, or other public figures on your behalf. If you complete a phone call using our call tool, we will not make that publicly available, either. Your phone number may be shared with your member of Congress, the President, or other public figures during your call.

By completing an action (like signing a petition or completing a phone call), you're opting in to receive 18MR.org updates by email. If you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so at any time. (Take a look at the footer of any email you've received from us for your personalized link.)

Your use of this site is consent to gather information about your visit. We track traffic and may also log information that helps us improve our website and tools. Most data will be collected in aggregate, such as through Google Analytics.

Our action platform, [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org), uses cookies to track your login to their system. You can read [their complete privacy policy here](https://actionnetwork.org/privacy).

You can block the use of these and other trackers using [the EFF's Privacy Badger plugin](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger). We won't be mad. (But you might need to disable it occasionally to fully load features on our site.)

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our treatment of your personal data, [please drop us a line](mailto:info@18millionrising.org).

#Community Guidelines

Please remember that comments on 18MR.org are public and our audience includes everyone from ages 13 to 93. We ask that you curb crude language on our site and we reserve the right moderate comments that attack particular individuals or groups; are not in the spirit of civil discourse; are not relevant to the subject matter; or violate our privacy policy. We tend to be generous, but we simply ask that you veer away from attacking people towards and towards interrogating their ideas.

Discourse over dissing, as a rule. We're here to build community, and we hope you are, too.
