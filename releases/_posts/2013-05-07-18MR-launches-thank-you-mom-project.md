In celebration of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month and Mother’s Day, 18MR has launched the [#TYMom (Thank You Mom) project](http://tymom.org/).

The project includes the production of a [“Thank You Mom” video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn9DTcnjWSQ) to express love and gratitude to moms -- as well as to our diverse AAPI heritages and communities. Video participants give special thanks to their moms, including creatives and community leaders like spoken word artist Bao Phi, blogger Phil Yu ([Angry Asian Man](http://www.angryasianman.com/)) and [Asian American Justice Center](http://www.advancingequality.org/) president and former Minnesota State Senator Mee Moua.

In addition to the video, 18MR has created a unique [#TYMom microsite](http://tymom.org/), where you can create a custom, multilingual thank you message for your mom -- or anyone who's mothered you. The [#TYMom site](http://tymom.org/) also features an interactive map showing where senders and recipients are located throughout the country.  

In addition to honoring our heritage, it's also a critical time for the AAPI community to support fair and just immigration reform. 18MR intends for the #TYMom project to highlight the importance of moms and the value of keeping families together within the current immigration debate. 18MR hopes that #TYMom will be just one example of how immigration reform should be rooted in our families.

So what are you waiting for, go [show your mom some love](http://tymom.org/)!
