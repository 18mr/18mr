Could you be the next great addition to the 18MR team?

## About 18MR.org
18MR.org was founded to promote AAPI civic engagement, influence and movement by leveraging the power of technology and social media. For the past four years, we've convened a network of creative, tech-savvy, and passionate individuals and organizations working in and with AAPI communities in every U.S. state and territory. 

Our theory of change involves empowering AAPI communities from within while cultureshifting the perspectives of those outside our communities. We work on a wide variety of projects, including year-round civic activity locally and nationally; campaigns to hold corporations accountable; build interracial coalitions; and develop our shared identities through popular culture and online engagement.

We’re agile, inspired, and create opportunities by bringing diverse partners into unlikely coalitions. 21st century community power can be built through smart tech and good organizing, and our campaign wins and vision are testament to how we can bring them together to advance rights and justice in our communities, in our country, in our nations of origins, and beyond.

## Summary
We are hiring for the role of Campaigner. Campaigners are the core of 18MR’s activities: keeping in touch with partners, prospecting and developing new campaigns and projects, ensuring that members have meaningful opportunities to participate, and co-creating the voice of the organization in coalitions, social media channels, and both online and traditional news coverage.

You’ll join a small, nimble team that is ambitious, detail-oriented, and highly engaged in everything from the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns and projects to shaping our analysis and vision of the world we want to build.

The ideal candidate thrives within a team but can work independently remotely day-to-day; is comfortable navigating the internet and developing online communities; excited by the fast pace of rapid-response campaigning; has an understanding of Asian American and Pacific Islander movements and history; able to think outside the box and pivot into rapid response quickly; and passionate about building the reputation of 18MillionRising.org (18MR) as a leading voice social, political, and cultural issues impacting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

The Campaigner will report to the Campaign Strategist.
