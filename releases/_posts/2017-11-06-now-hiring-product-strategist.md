We are using this Asian American identity as the foundation to build a more just and creative world where our experiences are affirmed, our leadership is valued, and all of us have the opportunity to thrive.

Using technology and popular culture, we develop new ways for Asian Americans and our allies to collaborate, create new ways of being, and transform the world around us.

## Summary
The 18MR Product Strategist is one part DIY hacker, one part movement tech visionary. In the past, this role has been filled by self-taught programmers and product managers whose expertise is shaped, first and foremost, by their experience as organizers. The Product Strategist will spend their time solving day-to-day problems with web-based tools; managing projects with effective and clear communication; and applying their technical and creative acumen to make things happen for our small team of online organizers and cultureshifters.

You’ll join a small, nimble team that is ambitious, detail-oriented, and highly engaged in everything from the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns and projects to shaping our analysis and vision of the world we want to build.

The ideal Product Strategist is flexible and creative, with a get-it-done attitude. They play well with others, are open to being proven wrong, have a good sense of their strengths and limitations (and feel comfortable asking for help when they’re out of their depth), and have a passion for igniting the imaginations of non-technical collaborators. They are detail-oriented and know how to communicate about expectations, deliverables, and deadlines with remote peers and contractors. They work well with end users and capably facilitate community-led product design with a spirit of co-creation and mutual learning.

The Product Strategist has two main roles: the day-to-day management and operation of 18MR’s technology stack, and guiding the development of new features and products, such as [VoterVOX](https://www.votervox.org) and improvements to our online campaigning tools, for the 18MR campaigns team, in service of social movements.
