Could you be the next great addition to the 18MR team?

## About 18MR.org
18MillionRising.org (18MR.org) brings many disparate Asian American communities together online and offline to reimagine Asian American identity with nuance, specificity, and power. We are using this Asian American identity as the foundation to build a more just and creative world where our experiences are affirmed, our leadership is valued, and all of us have the opportunity to thrive.

Using technology and popular culture, we develop new ways for Asian Americans and our allies to collaborate, create new ways of being, and transform the world around us.

As a member of the Allied Media Projects Sponsored Projects Network, we also hold the [AMP Network Principles](https://www.alliedmedia.org/about/network-principles) as central to our work.

Please read our [operating principles](https://18millionrising.org/about) before preparing your application.

## Summary
The 18MR.org Product Strategist loves solving tech problems for social justice. They apply existing tools in creative ways, know their way around front-end languages like Sass and Javascript, and enjoy thinking deeply about how technology works. The Product Strategist has two main roles: the day-to-day management and operation of 18MR.org’s campaigning stack, and guiding the development of new features and products for the campaigns team. 

A good Product Strategist has skills as a product manager, DIY hacker, and community organizer. In the past, this role has been filled by self-taught programmers and product managers whose expertise is shaped, first and foremost, by their experience as organizers. The Product Strategist will spend their time solving day-to-day problems with web-based tools; managing projects with effective and clear communication; and applying their technical and creative acumen to make things happen for our team of online organizers and cultureshifters.

You’ll join a small, nimble team that is ambitious, detail-oriented, and highly engaged in everything from the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns and projects to shaping our analysis and vision of the world we want to build. We are a remote team and need teammates who are motivated self-managers ready to take their work to the next level.

The ideal Product Strategist is flexible and creative, with a get-it-done attitude. They are motivated to devise culturally appropriate technology solutions for Asian American movements. They play well with others, are open to being proven wrong, know when to ask for help, and have a passion for igniting the imaginations of non-technical collaborators. They are detail-oriented and know how to communicate about expectations, deliverables, and deadlines with remote peers and contractors. They work well with end users and capably facilitate community-led product design with a spirit of co-creation and mutual learning.

The Product Strategist will report to the Executive Director.
