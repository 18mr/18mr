## About 18MR.org
18MillionRising.org (18MR.org) brings Asian American communities together online and offline to re-imagine Asian American identity with nuance, specificity, and power. We are using this Asian American identity as the foundation to build a more just and creative world where our experiences are affirmed, our leadership is valued, and all of us have the opportunity to thrive.

Using technology and popular culture, we develop new ways for Asian Americans and our allies to collaborate, create new ways of being, and transform the world around us. We utilize digital-first advocacy tactics to elevate the voices of and mobilize our over 120,000 members to take action on issues that matter to them. We create meeting places online where young Asian Americans can deliberate together about what it means to be Asian American in the 21st century.

Our theory of change involves empowering AAPI communities from within while cultureshifting the perspectives of those outside our communities. We work on a wide variety of projects, including year-round civic activity locally and nationally; campaigns to hold corporations accountable; building interracial coalitions; and developing our shared identities through popular culture and online engagement.
